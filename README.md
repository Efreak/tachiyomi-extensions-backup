# Tachiyomi Extensions

This is mainly for my own personal use, as I use tachiyomi on multiple devices 
configured to auto update through fdroid, and this way I can update all 
plugins on all of them just by pushing once and initiating a check. If you 
intend to do so as well, please use https://cdn.rawgit2.com/Efreak/tachiyomi-extensions/master/fdroid/repo/
