Name: AnimeGo-Re
Summary: GoGoAnime client
Description: |-
    Notes: This app seems to be an in-development replacement for an existing react-native app located at [https://github.com/HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime HenryQuan/React-Native-GoGoAnime]. I've corrected some typos and links, but probably won't be updating the description.

    '''This is not the official app'''

    It has been rewritten with <code>Flutter</code> to support IOS, tablets and web.

    * Side drawer design
    * Watch history (wip)
    * Favourite anime list (wip)

    * No popups while watching anime (IOS and Android only)

    I have abondoned this project for about 2 years but it is finally back. A complete rework is undergoing because <code>AnimeOne</code> doesn’t have some old animes. Flutter is now used instead of React Native. Some features are still under development but it is now stable enough to use. You could try [https://henryquan.github.io/AnimeGo-Re the web version] now.

    = Downloads =

    Only android build is available and you can download the apk from [https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/releases/latest releases/latest] (currently still in preview). However, IOS version is being tested and it works fine. You could [https://github.com/HenryQuan/AnimeGo-Re/tree/master/AnimeGo/README.md compile] it yourself.

    = Screenshots =

    New screenshots will be taken soon.
