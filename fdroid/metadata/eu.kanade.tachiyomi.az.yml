Name: TachiyomiAZ
Summary: Tachiyomi fork with extra sources & features, hamburger menu
Description: |-
    Note: This app does not differentiate dev builds from stable with a different package name like Tachiyomi does. If you don't want dev builds, disable this app or check the [https://github.com/az4521/TachiyomiAZ/releases/latest github releases page] before updating.

    This fork is based off of TachiyomiEH, it has most features and fixes from Dev, as well as features from J2k. It has decided to keep the hamburger menu style of navigation, compared to the other forks that are moving to the new bottom navigation style.
