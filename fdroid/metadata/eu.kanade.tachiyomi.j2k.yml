Description: |-
    Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android.

    * Local reading of downloaded manga
    * A configurable reader with multiple viewers, reading directions and other settings

    * Android 10 edge to edge support (and a translucent nav bar for older versions): no more small ugly bar for the gesture navigation
    * Automatic background based on manga page: For those that like having a white background to match the content, this will automatically set the background to match for moments such as a flashback section of a manga
    * [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomi/master/.github/readme-images/new%20notifcations%20collasped.png Richer New chapters notifications]: Now as a group of notifications, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomi/master/.github/readme-images/new%20notifcations.png expanding out to show more information] about the new chapters (like chapter name and manga cover).

    * Option to hide manga titles in grid view
    * Filter out your library by searching for tags (ex. "Comedy" or "Slice of Life") or exclude mangas by a tag (ex. "-Shounen" or "-Romance"). Tapping on these tags also performs a local search. You can also search multiple tags (ex. "Romance, -Harem, Comedy")
