Name: Tachiyomi (Jays2Kings Fork)

Description: |-
    Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android.

    * Online reading from sources such as KissManga, MangaDex, [https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions and more]
    * Local reading of downloaded manga
    * A configurable reader with multiple viewers, reading directions and other settings
    * [https://myanimelist.net/ MyAnimeList], [https://anilist.co/ AniList], [https://kitsu.io/explore/anime Kitsu], and [https://shikimori.one/ Shikimori] support
    * Categories to organize your library
    * Light and dark themes

    * Create backups locally to read offline or to your desired cloud service.
    
    Plus some new features in this fork such as:
    * Android 10 Dark Theme support: You can have Tachiyomi follow the system theme as well as customize which dark theme to use for dark mode
    * Android 10 edge to edge support (and a translucent nav bar for older versions): no more small ugly bar for the gesture navigation
    * Automatic background based on manga page: For those that like having a white background to match the content, this will automatically set the background to match for moments such as a flashback section of a manga
    * [Richer New chapters notifications https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomi/master/.github/readme-images/new%20notifcations%20collasped.png]: Now as a group of notifications, [expanding out to show more information https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomi/master/.github/readme-images/new%20notifcations.png] about the new chapters (like chapter name and manga cover). Tapping on it will bring you right into the chapter or expand it to mark it as read or view all chapters
    * [New material snackbar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jays2Kings/tachiyomi/master/.github/readme-images/material%20snackbar.png]: Removing manga now auto deletes chapters and has an undo button in case you change your mind

    * Option to hide manga titles in grid view
    * Filter out your library by searching for tags (ex. "Comedy" or "Slice of Life") or exclude mangas by a tag (ex. "-Shounen" or "-Romance"). Tapping on these tags also performs a local search. You can also search multiple tags (ex. "Romance, -Harem, Comedy")
    * Android X Support (''Becasue of this change needed for Android 10 features, extension preferences are currently disabled for all extensions except Mangadex'')
