    Apologies for the dual versions. One of the versions is a forked 
    version released by mabDc on github; the other is official version 
    1.0.6 by rechinx; the mabDc version did not include a version bump or 
    a different package name, so the only way to know which is which on 
    version 1.0.6 (via fdroid) is to install an older version and see if 
    the signature check fails during install. At the current time, the 
    forked version is at 1.0.8 while the official version is at 1.0.6. 
    Since I'm not actually using Meow at the moment, I will not be fixing 
    this issue (I've been too lazy to look up the differences in the 
    forked version, and intend to check it out eventually).
