https://github.com/balvinderz/animewatcher - no releases, no website :(
https://github.com/Sher1234/Horrible - has releases, but has multiple versions in the same release (v82, v84, etc), so uses /releases/latest won't necessarily help :(
https://github.com/LagradOst/CloudStream-2 - 65mb apk is *way* too big. If I split apps out of tachi ext repo, I'll add it then, maybe.
https://github.com/KurozeroPB/Nekos - need to look at this
https://github.com/nv95/Kotatsu/releases - need to look at this, possible continuation of https://github.com/nv95/OpenManga
https://github.com/Xonshiz/CoManga - I had this before, removed it. possibly still active due to single commit in jan 10.
https://github.com/axel05869/MangaLife - no source available. reads manga from mangalife.com
