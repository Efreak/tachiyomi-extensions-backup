- [balvinderz/animewatcher](https://github.com/balvinderz/animewatcher) - no releases, no website :(
- [Sher1234/Horrible](https://github.com/Sher1234/Horrible) - has releases, but has multiple versions in the same release (v82, v84, etc), so uses /releases/latest won't necessarily help :(
- [LagradOst/CloudStream-2](https://github.com/LagradOst/CloudStream-2) - 65mb apk is *way* too big. If I split apps out of tachi ext repo, I'll add it then, maybe.
- [KurozeroPB/Nekos](https://github.com/KurozeroPB/Nekos) - need to look at this
- [nv95/Kotatsu/releases](https://github.com/nv95/Kotatsu/releases) - need to look at this, possible continuation of [nv95/OpenManga](https://github.com/nv95/OpenManga)
- [Xonshiz/CoManga](https://github.com/Xonshiz/CoManga) - I had this before, removed it. possibly still active due to single commit in jan 10.
- [axel05869/MangaLife](https://github.com/axel05869/MangaLife) - no source available. reads manga from mangalife.com
